The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a scientific and medical program 
aimed at improving our understanding of Cancer Biology. 
Several TCGA Datasets are available online, and some are hosted

interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets. 
TCGAretriever helps accessing and downloading TCGA data via the 
cBioPortal API. Features of TCGAretriever are:
